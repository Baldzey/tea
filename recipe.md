The recipe is:

Lightly crush the whole spices before tossing into a pot of water with the black tea.


Then:


Bring one cup of water with the spices and loose tea, just to a boil- then turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes. Boiling the tea will make it bitter, so just bring it to a boil.

Once it steeps, add the milk.

Then Just strain and serve!

ENJOY! :)
